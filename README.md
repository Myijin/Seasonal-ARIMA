# Seasonal-ARIMA
Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used for predicting enrolment and revenue. ACF and PACF charts were plotted to find the optimal parameters. Residual and normal Q-Q plots were plotted for diagnostic.

For example, the model for certain course is with R^2 = 0.964, and the correlation coefficient of predicted value (in black) and true enrolment (in blue) is 0.99.
